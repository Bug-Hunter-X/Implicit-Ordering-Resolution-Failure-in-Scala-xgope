This repository demonstrates a common error in Scala related to implicit Ordering resolution.  The `MyClass` uses an implicit `Ordering` in `myMethod`, which works fine with `Int` due to Scala's built-in `Ordering.Int`. However, calling it with `String` fails because `String` doesn't have a default `Ordering` instance. The solution shows how to provide a specific implicit `Ordering` for `String` or use a more flexible approach if applicable.
